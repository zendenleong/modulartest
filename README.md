1) A majority of the time was spent familiarising with the different libraries used to webscrape the ASPX file website on https://www.ccilindia.com/FPI_ARCV.aspx.
2) I have found that scrapy was ideal as a webscraping tool. However, there were a lot of bugs faced during the downloading of the excel files which is of a different format from the 'export to excel' button (code is in myspider.py)
3) The remaining bulk of the time was trying to establish a connection to Azure SQL database and inserting a test excel file into the database. However, there were problems establishing the connection due to firewall issues.
4) Although I have faced many different bugs and problems throughout this coding test, it was truly an enriching experience exploring more in depth on webscraping as well as using cloud services like Azure SQL.
